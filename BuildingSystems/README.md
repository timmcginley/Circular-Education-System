# Agile Building Systems

We have been experimenting with decoupling the systems of buildings since the initial Agile X experiments in 2015.

Initially we were intersted in seperating out the design, material and fabrication/consruction systems.
This was to avoid the deisgn team gettting locked into to a specific design, material choice or construction method.
The Agile Prototyping experiments at DTU since 2018, have focused on decoupling the design systems of the design team. Typically we do this using the same disciplines we use in the other courses so:

* Architecture
* Structure
* MEP
* Fire Safety
* Materials
* Project Management

Early promising experiments were conducted in Speckle V1. These need to be updated to work with Speckle V2.
