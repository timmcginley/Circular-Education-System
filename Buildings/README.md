# Buildings

Since 2019 in Advanced Building Design we have run the same project on the same site. When we started doing this a real project on the site was still in design for the site, it is now built!

In that time in our course, 59 different interdisiplinary projects have been produced by our students. This page gives some overview of the different years, including the subjects the students could choose from and the iniatives we started or stopped that year.

### 2019 - 12 Buildings
* This was the 10th year the course had run including: architecture, Structure, MEP, Geotechnical, Fire and PM/ICT subjects.
* Run during a lockdown
* Students formed groups
* The last year that we ran in the autumn.
* It ran from the AgileX website [(no longer live but can find the repository here)](https://github.com/timmcginley/F21)

* Had less teams as it was the first year we ran in the spring.
* 2 students in each subject, it was the first time that we had more than one student in each subject.
* Received teaching and learning fund from DTU and worked with Thomas Krijnen to develop a rule checking system.
### 2021 - 11 Buildings
* Introduced the Beats.
* It is documented in [McGinley & Krijnen (2021)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355218194_Multi-disciplinary_learning_from_OpenBIM)
### 2022 - 9 Buildings

### 2023 - 9 Buildings
* Added a materials subject for the first time.
* Added 2 weeks of physical model building at the start of the course, to support the team to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of the challenges of the project.
* Added the summary poster.
* Added the CO2 e / m2 / permanant desk, to get a comparable idea of the sustainability of the building.y
* Added a drawing pin up session in week 7.
* Added the DGNB-Lite schema to support sustainability assessment in the course. We wrote about this version in [McGinley et. al. (2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372244146_Supporting_the_OpenBIM_transition) and [McGinley & Krijnen (2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369107975_A_framework_for_meta-disciplinary_building_analysis).
### 2024 - 12 Buildings
* Did not include a geotechnical or material subject (only for this year).
* Incorporated the fire subject (evacuation) into Architecture.
* This year got a summary poster.
* First year it was a mandatory course for civil engineering MSc which resulted in large number of students who wanted to take the structures subject.
* Effort to put the course information information into [Github](https://github.com/timmcginley/41936).
* Effort to consolidate project information into DTU Learn.
  
### 2025 - ?

Switched the github site from Jekyll to [Sphinx documentation](https://timmcginley.github.io/41936/).

Add mentors. Add acoustics to Architecture. Reinstate Geotechnical subject. Course information needs to be cleaned up and a new course website is needed.
