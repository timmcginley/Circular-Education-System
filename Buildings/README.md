# Buildings

Since 2019 in Advanced Building Design we haev run the same project on the same site. When we started doing this a real project on the site was still in design for the site, it is now built!

In that time in the course 59 different interdisiplinary projects have been produced by our students.

In this page we give some overview of the 

### 2019 - 12 Buildings
This first year was run during a lockdown. It had architecture, Structure, MEP, Geotechnical, Fire and PM/ICT subject. Students formed groups. It ran from the AgileX website.
### 2020 - 6 Buildings
This was also affected by Lockdown. This year had less teams. This year we had 2 students in each subject, it was the first time that we had more than one student in each subject.
### 2021 - 11 Buildings
This was the year we introduced the Beats.
### 2022 - 9 Buildings
### 2023 - 9 Buildings
This year included a materials subject for the first time. Also it included 2 weeks of model building at the start of the course, to support the team to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of the challenges of the project. This was the first year that got a summary poster. Also it was the first year that we used the CO2 e / m2 / permanant desk, to get a comparable idea of the sustainability of the building. This was also the first year that we had a drawing pin up session in week 7. Introduced the DGNB-Lite schema to support sustainability assessment in the course.
### 2024 - 12 Buildings
This year did not include a geotechnical or material subject. The fire subject (evacuation) was incorporated into Architecture. This year got a summary poster. It was the first year it was a mandatory course for civil engineering MSc which resulted in large number of students who wanted to take the structures subject. Effort to consolidate project information into DTU Learn.
### 2025 - ?
Add mentors. Add acoustics to Architecture. Reinstate Geotechnical subject. Course information needs to be cleaned up and a new course website is needed.
